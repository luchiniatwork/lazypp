  "Here's where your slide-set is created. Return an array mixing strings, and
  hiccup data points.

  The following helper functions are available: `slide`, `big`, `small`, `items`,
  and `code`. All of them can be used at the root level of the slide or composed
  to create more advanced formats.

  See `parser.clj` for more details on the helper functions.

  Simple strings are simply wrapped in a `slide` call."
